      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>I was born in the Republic Democratic of Congo, and moved to the United State in 2015.
          I love being active, by exercising and being in conection with nature. I love board games like: chess, checker, and sudoku. They help me improve my critical and analical ways of thinking. 
          I am passionate about the Computer Science field for the opportunities it provides to inovate and create new technologies.</p>
          
       <h2>Projects</h2>
       <p>I have worked on projects such as:</p>       
       <p>MineField, Imaginary-Soldier, and Class-Grades</p>
       <p>I completed class grades using lists and dictionaries in python, with a set of different grades for students the project had to calculate and return the grades average of individual students and the whole class in general.</p>
       <p>MineField and imaginary Soldiers were completed using java; MineField consisted of a 2 dimentional board field with a specific number of mines desired by user. I desided the game using basic java tools such as Arrays, this was my proper introduction to Java.</p>
